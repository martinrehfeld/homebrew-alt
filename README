# simonair/alt

This is the repository of [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) formulas by [simonair](https://github.com/simonair).

Recent versions of Homebrew have the ability to install brews from both
URLs and local file paths.

This repository contains UNOFFICIAL brews that have not been accepted into
the master branch.

These brews can be installed via the raw GitHub URLs, or by cloning this
repository locally and installing off the local disk.

This REPLACES the "Homebrew Duplicates" branch.
